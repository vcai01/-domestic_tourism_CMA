# Domestic Tourism in Canadian Metropolitan Areas (CMA)

## Overview

Here is an exploratory data analysis on the data set of Travel Survey of Residents of Canada from Statistics Canada. From the data from 2011 to 2017, I tried to understand its structure, and find out:
    
1. Top 10 destinations (CMA) in 2017 by visitation and expenditures
2. Growth in domestic tourism expenditure and visitation from 2011 to 2017

The visitation and expenditures were annual data. If the monthly data was available, we may use time series models to analyze the trend and cyclic patterns and forcast the domestic visitation and expenditures in the short term.
